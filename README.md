# Description
The goal of this project is to evaluate and analyze the following classification algorithms for classifying the test times data to the correct sort type category.
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbors for Classification

# Data
This project uses the same data as the [sorting algorithms analysis](https://github.com/irisfield/sorting-algorithms-analysis) and the [sorting algorithms predictions](https://github.com/irisfield/sorting-algorithms-predictions) projects.
